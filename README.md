# Tutorific

Tutorific is a one-stop bi-directional platform for tutors and tutees to find each other without the hassle of a middle man. Gone are the days where tutors have to go through a tuition agency to find tutees just to find out that there is a mismatch of expectations with the allocated tutee.

Tutorific provides tutors and tutees with all the transparency and power they need to find the one that can best fulfill their academic needs, instead of relying on a hidden matching algorithm. Visit https://tutorific.herokuapp.com to try it out today!
